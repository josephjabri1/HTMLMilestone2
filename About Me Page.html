    <p style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; color:#56310d;" align="center">
        Hi my name is Joseph Jabri, I am a 17 year old Freshman (technically Sophmore) at GCU. I went to Sandra Day O'Connor High School, and I graduated a year early.
        I did this by taking extra classes online both during the school year and during the summer. It wasn't easy but it was really worth it. Although I said I was a freshman,
        my estimated graduation date is set to be in April of 2026 which would technically make me a Sophmore right now. Something cool about me is that I am <i>Assyrian</i>.
        I am bilingual and English is actually my second language, my first language is <i>Assyrian</i>. A <b>fun fact</b> about <i>Assyrians</i> is that we speak the same language Jesus
        did. Assyrians originated from the Middle East. Most, lke my father and grandparents, are from what is modern day Iraq. While my father was born in Iraq, my mom, along with me and my brother were
        born in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago has one of the largest Assyrian populations in America right now. Three months after I was born, my family moved to Phoenix.
